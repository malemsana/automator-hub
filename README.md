Of course. A great README is the front door to your entire project. It needs to be welcoming, informative, and clear.

Based on everything we've built, here is a complete, professional `README.md` file. It's written in Markdown, so you can copy and paste it directly into the `README.md` file in your project's root directory.

Automator Hub is a cross-platform desktop application built for developers, hobbyists, and power-users who need to automate tasks in the browser. It provides a simple UI to manage multiple, isolated browser profiles and a rich scripting environment, powered by Puppeteer, to build powerful, data-driven automation agents.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üóÇÔ∏è Isolated Profile Management:** Create an unlimited number of browser profiles, each with its own cookies, sessions, and storage. Organize them into colored **Groups** to manage complex workflows with bulk actions.
*   **ü§ñ Powerful Scripting Environment:** Write your automation scripts using the familiar and powerful **Puppeteer API**. A built-in editor with syntax highlighting makes scripting a breeze.
*   **üöÄ Advanced Scripting APIs:** Go beyond simple macros. Scripts have secure access to a powerful suite of backend APIs:
    *   **Private Database:** Each script gets its own SQLite database to persist and aggregate data across multiple profiles.
    *   **Secure Workspace:** Read, write, and download files to a sandboxed folder unique to each script.
    *   **Backend Networking:** Make external API calls from your scripts that bypass browser limitations like CORS.
*   **üìä In-App Apps & Dashboards:** Scripts can generate their own custom HTML user interfaces. These **Dashboards** automatically appear in a dedicated "Apps" screen, allowing you to create rich data visualizations, custom control panels, and asset managers.
*   **üñ•Ô∏è Real-time Monitoring:** The "Mission Control" screen provides a live log of your job's progress, with clear error reporting and full stack traces to make debugging easy.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Installation

You can download the latest version of Automator Hub from our official releases page.

**[‚û°Ô∏è Go to the Latest Release Page](https://github.com/malemsana/automator-hub/releases/latest)**

*   **For Windows:** Download the `automator_hub_setup.exe` file and run the installer.
*   **Portable:** Download the `.zip` file, extract it anywhere on your computer, and run the `Automator Hub.exe` executable.

### 2. Your First Script

Let's run a simple "Hello World" to see how it works.

1.  **Create a Profile:** Open the app, navigate to the **Profiles** screen, and click the **`+`** button in the top right to create your first profile. Make sure its toggle switch is enabled (blue).

2.  **Create a Script:** Go to the **Scripts** screen and click the **`+`** button. Give your script a name like "My First Script". The editor will open.

3.  **Add Code:** Paste the following code into the editor and click **Save**.
    ```javascript
    // This is your first script!

    console.log('Hello from Automator Hub!');
    console.log('I am currently running on profile:', automator.getProfileName());

    // Let's navigate to a website
    await page.goto('https://www.google.com');

    console.log('Task complete. Closing the browser.');
    
    // In v0.2.0+, you must close the browser yourself at the end of a job.
    await browser.close();
    ```

4.  **Run the Job:** Go to **Mission Control**, click the **üöÄ Run New Job** button, select "My First Script" from the dropdown, and click **Launch Job**. You will see a browser window open briefly, and the logs will appear in the Mission Control console!

## üìú Scripting API Documentation

Scripts have access to several global objects for powerful automation.

*   `page` & `browser`: The standard Puppeteer **Page** and **Browser** objects.
*   `automator`: A global object with helper functions and APIs.
*   `db`: An object for interacting with your script's private database.
